### NoCycle

See http://hostilefork.com/nocycle for information about this project.

Note: This code was originally done as a thought-experiment in 2009.  At the
time I didn't know much about the state of C++11 (which was then known as
"C++0x").  There weren't a lot of good internet resources for working with
the spec that had been evolving, so I just did it in plain C++98.  I was not
very knowledgable about templates at the time, and using Boost.Graph for the
first time was a bit of a challenge.

In the interest of making it a bit more presentable a decade later, I'm doing
some idle cleanup.
