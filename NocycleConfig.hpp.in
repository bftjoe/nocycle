//     conditional compilation of the Nocycle...mostly to do with debug
//     code.  Although the boost library is needed for much of the
//     testing, if you aren't doing a test build then it should not
//     be necessary to include any boost libraries (at least, not yet).

// Though nocycle distinguishes between vertices that have no connections
// and those which "don't exist", boost's default assumption is that
// all nodes in its capacity "exist".  The only way to conceptually delete
// a boost vertex from an adjacency_matrix it is to remove all of its
// incoming and outgoing connections.  Though it is possible to inject
// a vertex property map to track existence, the property map adds overhead
// and may not fairly represent boost's performance in scenarios with
// large numbers of nodes when existence tracking is not needed.
#cmakedefine01 BOOSTIMPLEMENTATION_TRACK_EXISTENCE

// Asserts are known to slow down the debug build.  But sometimes, you
// want to have the debug information available while still not having
// assertions run...e.g. so you can pause to see where execution is
// getting held up (a kind of poor-man's profiling).

// If caching the transitive closure...
// There is an "extra tristate" we get in the canreach graph when there is a physical
// edge in the data graph.  We can use this to accelerate the invalidation process,
// but for testing purposes it's nice to make sure the algorithms aren't corrupting
// this implicitly when modifying other edges.
#cmakedefine01 DIRECTEDACYCLICGRAPH_USER_TRISTATE

// If caching the transitive closure...
// ...and the extra tristate per edge is NOT visible to the user...
// Then use it to cache whether a vertex can be reached even after the physical link
// to it is removed from the graph.
